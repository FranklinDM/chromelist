info.status.done              = Done.

problem.unrecognized.url          = You're mapping %S to be the %S provider for the %S package, but apparently this is not a local file. Please make sure this is the case, as privileging remote code is bad.
problem.convertChromeURL.failure  = You're mapping a %S provider for the %S package, but the Chrome Service hasn't registered it. This may mean the current application fails an application or version check, or that the URL you gave was not parseable. Check your syntax carefully.
problem.noFile                    = Trying to map a %S provider for the %S package, but the file it's mapped to (%S) doesn't exist.
problem.mappedToFile              = Trying to map a %S provider for the %S package, but the file it's mapped to (%S) is not a directory.
problem.mappedToEmptyDir          = Trying to map a %S provider for the %S package, but the directory it's mapped to (%S) is empty. This may be intentional, just letting you know!
problem.noJarFile                 = Trying to map a %S provider for the %S package, but the jar it's mapping to (%S) doesn't exist.
problem.fileNotInJar              = Trying to map a %S provider for the %S package, but the path given to use within the %S jarfile does not exist in it. Please check your zipping procedures for this jarfile carefully.

problem.override.notApplied       = Trying to override %S with the file at %S, but as far as Chrome List can tell it didn't work (the Chrome Service is reporting a different URL for the URL you're overriding).
problem.override.pathDoesNotExist = Trying to override %S with the file at %S, but the latter does not exist.
problem.override.unrecognized.url = Trying to override %S with the file at %S, but it's not a local URL. This means the chrome protocol handler will stop you from being able to use it.
problem.override.isDir            = Trying to override %S with the directory at %S, but overriding directories is useless.
problem.override.noJarFile        = Trying to override %S with the jar at %S, but the latter does not exist.
problem.override.fileNotInJar     = Trying to override %S with the file at %S, but that path doesn't exist in the jar.
problem.override.jarFailure       = Trying to override %S with the file at %S, but failed to read the jar URI due to an exception: %S.
